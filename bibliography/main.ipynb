While in other contexts the best performing gradient-type methods invariably rely on some form of acceleration/momentum to reduce the number of iterations, there are no methods which combine the benefits of both gradient compression and acceleration. In this paper, we remedy this situation and propose the first accelerated compressed gradient descent (ACGD) methods. In the single machine regime, we prove that ACGD enjoys the rate <svg aria-label=\"O\\Big((1+\\omega)\\sqrt{\\frac{L}{\\mu}}\\log \\frac{1}{\\epsilon}\\Big)\" class=\"gs_fsvg\" height=\"26px\"
