title: An Optimal Algorithm for Strongly Convex Minimization under Affine Constraints
date: 22 Feb 2021
abstract: Optimization problems under affine constraints appear in various areas of machine learning. We consider the task of minimizing a smooth strongly convex function $F(x)$ under the affine constraint $Kx = b$, with an oracle providing evaluations of the gradient of $F$ and matrix-vector multiplications by $K$ and its transpose. We provide lower bounds on the number of gradient computations and matrix-vector multiplications to achieve a given accuracy. Then we propose an accelerated primal-dual algorithm achieving these lower bounds. Our algorithm is the first optimal algorithm for this class of problems.
